# Modern Oerating Systems 5th edition

## Introduction
### The purpose of an operating system 
An operating system has two main goals
- Providing a logical, predictable, unique, ordered (i.e. beautiful) interface
    for programs and user to access the hardware,
    when said hardware is messy,variable , and filled with caveats.
- Ensuring a fair share of the resources a computer provides among all the users
    (definition of fair may vary)

### Very Brief history of operating systems 
#### 1945-1955
Operating system do not exist. Programmers are completely knowledgeable
about the hardware and write all their program either
- in machine code,
- hardwire it with electronics and copper inside the computer itself !
These programs run on very big computers : mainframes.

#### 1955-1965
With the apparition of the first IC's, starting to replace vacuum tubes,
An embryo of operating system starts to emerge.
It runs on magnetic tapes.
It is closer to a "bootloader/shell" for one program only at any given time though.
The programming languages of the time which reached us to this day are Fortran and Cobol.
Mainframes are still the only type of computer to exist.

#### 1965-1980
We know start to see full fledged operating systems,with
- multiple programs sharing memory
- file systems 
- multi CPU support
- shell (not really at the time, but could be thought of today)
One famous operating system of the time is 
MULTICS (MULTIplexed Information and Computing Service)

Now the access to computers
starts to widen, with one main frame and many access terminals.
They start to be found in small numbers in
universities, banks and other businesses.

Some food for thought: 
The first official release of MULTICS dates 1969,
who could have predicted that 40 years later, anyone could get
for under 1000$ a computer 10.000 times faster ?


#### 1980-20XX (Today)
In this period of times are born
Minix (1987)
Linux (1991) "just a hobby, won't be big and professional like GNU"
Windows (it's ancestor MS-DOS in 1981)
OSX (2001)
Free-BSD (1993)
