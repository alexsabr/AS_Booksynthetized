## Introduction
### Network sizes 
#### PAN(Personal Area Network)
Network which allows devices in very close proximity to communicate together ,
NFC, Bluetooth

#### LAN( Local Area Network)
Devices are located in close proximity, same room, same house, same building
WiFi, Ethernet Cable, Power Line Communication.
There also exists VLAN which allows to separate traffic on a same Physical LAN 
into multiple "Virtual" LANs.

#### MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
Network having the size of a city
example : Cable TV which spanned across a whole city
WiMax ( not well known)
fiber optic spanning through city 


#### WAN ( Wide Area Network )
Country or even Continent Sized Network
Sonet link
Fiber optic Country backbone ?
Starlink
### Brief History of networking  (or the history of internet)
#### Arpanet
The first Wide Area Network, spanning across the United states of America. 
Ordered by the Arpa, the ancestor of DARPA (Agency which decide in what defense project invest US' administration money )
Linking together 4 universities in  December 1969, 34 in September 1972.
Packet switching method  (that is data is separated in chunks (packet) before being shared on the network to be recomposed by the receiver)
was already implemented. It was composed of 2 types of machines : 
hosts which wanted to  communicate with other hosts (to retrieve data or open a distant session)
and IMP (Interface Message Processor) which where underpowered computers with the sole purpose of 
transmitting around packets of data emitted by a host.

#### NSFNET
Another network based on the success of Arpanet in the Academic world, with the main purpose
of making Super computer computing power accessible to more universities.

#### Internet
The internet as we know it more or less appeard in 1989 With the apparition of Commercial ISP in the United States of America.
the IP protocole suite which is a fundamental part of the Internet was introduced in January 1983.

## Physical Layer
Note : As I'm no electronical engineer, 
this part really does not interests me and I've felt free to oversee many pages about the physical Layer.
