Core ideas :
- Gradual changes rule.

- Small improvements one at the time are key to success.

- Leveraging the power of the masses will get you anywhere.

- We may be working with machines, but we are still working for and along people, efficient communication and sociability aren't buzzwords.

- Knowledge in the information era can be bought at the price of lead and sold at the price of gold. Make " I don't know but I'll find out " your adage.

- Jack of all Trades, Master of one : have core technologies, yet dab in many.


What Makes a pragmatic Programmer ? 
In One sentence,
Care about your Craft. Care about programming. Care about Technology.
Why are  you even in the field if you don't ? 

- Early Adopter / fast adapter 
When a new technology comes out,
you should be out there trying it, weighin pros and cons
evaluating the possibilities it offers. Beware of snake oil and miraculous solutions !

- Inquisitive 
You never ask  enough question. Until you know the inside out of something, you should always seek more knowledge. As states the marginal gains philosophy  "By performing many small improvements, you manage to obtain an effect greater than the sum of all small improvements."

- Critical thinker 
Juste because everyone does something in a certain way does not mean there isn't a better way. Remove emotions, keep hard cold facts.

- Realistic 
To hell with unreasonable dead lines and expectations. 
You can be Idealistic in your goals, but when the coding comes,
nothing is worse than over-promising AND under-delivering.
Besides, unrealistic expectations can make you perform worse by 
undermining  your confidence and clouding your judgement.

- Jack of all trades 
Being a specialist whose unable to switch of field is the death of vision, critical thinking and creativity. One should always have many tools in it's toolbox  to be able to tackle any problems. 


### 1. It's Your life
By the time you enter in the workforce, your life condition is your fault.
Programming is among the top fields which provide great control for an individual on it's outcome. Don't like something ? change it or move away from it. "You can change your company or change of  company" _Martin Fowler_ https://wiki.c2.com/?BrainsAsaCheapCommodity

### 2.The cat Ate my source code
A follow up of [[pragmatic-programmer#1. It's Your life]]
but about your code. You are responsible and accountable  for the code (and more broadly, the work ) you output. You consequently should strive to hold it to a high Standard. Which means  
- question (the problem until your intimately familiar with it) 
- prototype (to ensure your answer works) 
- backup (your save files)
- clean (the workspace)
- communicate (your advancement and shortcomings).
When your sentence begins with I don't know ...
make sure it finishes with "but I'll find out ! " / I don't know ___yet___.



### 3.Software Entropy
What happens if you do not respect  [[pragmatic-programmer#2.The cat Ate my source code]] ? Software entropy. Small defects appear, start to accumulate, and before long the whole project is a mess because everyone saw the writings on the wall and stopped trying. 
By all means detect, document and clean software rot before the whole code is lost.  If you find yourself in an already rotting software,
you can start small and accumulate cleaning over the long run. 
As the saying goes "How do you eat an elephant ? One bite at the time."
Also make sure when you are cleaning entropy to not introduce new defects,
otherwise you aren't really cleaning anything.

### 4. Stone Soup 
Three  ideas 
- Teamwork makes the dream work
- Be a catalyst for change / the change you want to see.
- Help yourself and other will come to help you out, maybe eager to join an already rolling train heading straight to success.
It narrates the story of three soldiers coming to a  tight belted belly village after years of wars. No villagers wants to give them food so they sit down 
and decide to boil a stone soup. Before long one villager come and they manage to get him to offer them some herbs for the soup, a small addition.
Then other villager comes and they manage each time to get something a bit more interesting in exchange for sharing a bowl of the upcoming soup. Before long everyone has brought something to the soup, more costly as time passes, and in the end everyone ends up eating a nice soup with many ingredients.

Gradual changes and leveraging  the power of the masses is the key here.

### 5.Good Enough software
Better  is the enemy of Good.
Now don't get me wrong, this isn't a call to mediocrity or to be contempt with crappy barely working software.
This is a call to include the customer in the development so he can make calls on  the trade-off, what functionality is core to his problem, and what is "good enough" for them.


### 6. Your Knowledge Portfolio
Any money invested on knowledge is good money invested period.
If you want to have more granularity, try those tips: 
- Knowledgeable people seek to increase knowledge, see what it means to be a pragmatic programmer.
- Diversify your knowledge and become a Jack of all trades person 
- Diversify also means investing your time in learning not only tried and tested technology, but also dabbing in high risk high reward emerging technologies
- Check periodically for directions to be sure you are learning applicable knowledge

Actions to make you act upon this principle : learn a new programming language, or programming paradigm, or database paradigm, or operating system. Take part in talk sessions, attend or give conferences, take a course, pass a certification.

### 7. Communicate ! 
(efficiently)
- Know what you want to say

- Know the audience
You do not have the same keypoints if you are talking to a customer board,
an engineer board, a marketing board, etc. And if you do, it is time to start thinking in term of their interests ! 
- Choose a style
i.e a style that suits your audience !

- Choose your moment (and format !)
It goes along with Know your audience 

- Polish the presentation 
The best  ideas brought without any care for the form have are on an equal footing with terrible ones nicely packaged.
Even worse if said idea although completely correct is provocative.


- Involve the audience
Your Audience can either be a firing squad, waiting for one wrong step to fall on you  or a thrilled customer, eager to help you sell him something.

- LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAY FFS
You aren't a dictator are you ? How many stories have you heard where catastrophe could have been avoided if only the main protagonist would have listened to a recurring and objective concern or advice ?

- Get Back to people
Don't be the kind of person who "prouds" himself in being unorganized and forgetting to answer half of their emails. Show dilligency,
and of course, always during work hours only !

A tip for writing documentation.
"Code Never lies, comments sometimes do "
Don't Repeat Yourself
Avoid explaining what is happening, apart from API documentation, their is code for that. Instead explain why something was done this way, 
so if down the line, the code works in a totally different manner,
First the reader will quickly detect it and know to dismiss the old comment,
not be left wondering for hours wether the comment is deprecated or 
Second the reader may be able to trace back why it is no longer done this way.

Generally, each function should be documented as follows  :
What are the valid arguments 
What will be  answered given valid arguments
What it does 
Edge case and errors.
